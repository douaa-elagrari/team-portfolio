PROJECT TITLE:
Web-Based System for Connecting Patients with Home Healthcare Providers

OVERVIEW:
This project is a web-based platform designed to connect patients with qualified home healthcare providers across Algeria’s 58 Wilayas. It simplifies the process of finding doctors, nurses, and caregivers who offer home medical services by providing a searchable, region-based directory with detailed professional profiles.

MISSION STATEMENT:
Finding available and trusted home healthcare professionals in Algeria is often difficult, especially when searching by region or medical specialty.
Our platform addresses this issue by offering a centralized, user-friendly solution that improves access to essential home healthcare services.
This system primarily benefits elderly patients, people with limited mobility, and families who require medical care at home. It contributes to reducing hospital congestion and increasing patient comfort.

KEY FEATURES:

Search for healthcare providers by Wilaya and specialty.

Doctor/Nurse/Caregiver registration with profile creation (CV, experience, contact information).

Dynamic display of newly added professionals on the homepage.

Responsive design suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Database integration (MySQL) to store user and profile data.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (WISH LIST):

User accounts that allow patients to rate and save favorite providers.
